Initial thoughts:

1. get data from Riot API
2. design and write NN
3. feed data and train
4. deploy using Overwolf framework
5. collect reinforcement feedback data from users and improve the model

How can OpenL9 be useful?
1. Improve recall timers based on high elo data and game state context.
2. Analyze proactivity and usefulness on the map.
3. (experimental) provide feedback in an LLM way like ChatGPT based on context.

TODO:
Study to use Riot API
